since the authors of the numerical recipes have not
indexed their programs, so i think it would be worth
while to name the programs by their page number on which
they appear, preceded by its word introduction, that
should contain the key phrases.

so for example i've named the first program of julian
day numbers on page 3 as:

pp003_FullMoon.cpp

this taxonomical routine will help in keeping the
decorum and also giving the flexibility to choose
exotic names.

cheers!
